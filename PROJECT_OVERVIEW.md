# ASH-Grid AI – Project Overview

## Objective
To build an autonomous self-healing AI system that prevents transformer failures and optimizes smart grid resilience.

## Core Shift
ASH-Grid does not just predict faults — it simulates outcomes and recommends corrective actions before failure occurs.

## Modules
1. Real-Time Grid Monitoring Dashboard  
2. Transformer Stress DNA Engine  
3. AI Load Forecasting & Climate Risk Alerts  
4. Self-Healing Recommendation System  
5. Critical Infrastructure Priority Engine  
6. Grid Resilience Scoring  
7. Reports & Maintenance Actions  

## Impact
- Prevents outages  
- Extends transformer lifetime  
- Reduces maintenance cost  
- Improves smart city energy reliability
