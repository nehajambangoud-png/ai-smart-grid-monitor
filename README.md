# ⚡ ASH-Grid AI – Autonomous Self-Healing Transformer Network

A smart grid intelligence platform designed to monitor transformer health, predict failures early, and recommend preventive self-healing actions to improve power system resilience.

---

##  Project Overview

Transformers are the backbone of electrical distribution systems.  
Traditional monitoring systems only provide alerts after stress conditions occur.

**ASH-Grid AI goes beyond monitoring** by introducing:

- Transformer stress profiling  
- Predictive risk intelligence  
- AI-based corrective recommendations  
- Urban resilience scoring  

This project demonstrates how AI can support smarter and safer grid operations.

## Key Features

### Real-Time Transformer Health Monitoring
Tracks critical operational parameters such as:

- Load percentage  
- Oil temperature  
- Efficiency  
- Voltage levels  

---

### Transformer Stress DNA Profile
Each transformer is assigned a unique stress signature based on:

- Thermal accumulation  
- Electrical fatigue  
- Load imbalance  

This helps identify early-stage degradation patterns.

---

###  Self-Healing Recommendation Engine
Instead of only raising warnings, the system suggests actions like:

- Load redistribution  
- Cooling improvements  
- Power factor correction  

---

###  Critical Infrastructure Priority
The platform supports community-aware protection by prioritizing zones such as:

- Hospitals  
- Schools  
- Water supply networks  

---

###  Climate & Seasonal Load Intelligence
Predicts overload risks during:

- Heatwaves  
- Festival peak demand  
- Seasonal consumption changes  

---

###  Grid Resilience Scoring
Provides city-level resilience insights based on:

- Risk distribution  
- Redundancy strength  
- Maintenance efficiency  

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript  
- **Build Tool:** Vite  
- **Routing:** React Router  
- **Data Model:** Transformer health dataset (static simulation)
