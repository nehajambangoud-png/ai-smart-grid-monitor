# ASH-Grid AI ⚡🤖  
### Autonomous Self-Healing Transformer Network for Smart Grid Resilience

ASH-Grid AI is a next-generation smart grid intelligence platform that goes beyond monitoring and prediction.

Unlike traditional systems that only detect failures, ASH-Grid continuously evaluates transformer stress, simulates corrective actions, and recommends optimal self-healing interventions before breakdown occurs.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Modern power grids face overload risk, transformer aging, climate-driven demand spikes, and critical infrastructure dependency.

ASH-Grid AI prevents failures by predicting stress accumulation and enabling proactive grid optimization.
