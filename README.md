AI Smart Grid Monitor
AI-Driven Predictive Transformer Monitoring System for Smart Cities
Overview

AI Smart Grid Monitor is a predictive transformer health monitoring system designed for urban power distribution networks.

Instead of reacting to transformer failures after they occur, this system analyzes multiple electrical parameters simultaneously and estimates risk levels in advance. It enables preventive maintenance, improves grid reliability, and supports smart city infrastructure management.

This prototype is built using realistic distribution-level voltage standards (33kV / 11kV / 433V) modeled for the Hubli–Dharwad region.

 Problem Statement

Distribution transformers are critical infrastructure assets. However, many are monitored through:

Periodic manual inspections

Basic threshold-based alerts

Reactive maintenance practices

By the time a fault is detected, outages and equipment damage may have already occurred.

There is a need for a predictive, intelligent monitoring system that can identify degradation patterns before critical failure.

 Proposed Solution

This system introduces an AI-based predictive monitoring layer that evaluates:

Load behavior

Voltage deviation

Oil aging and temperature

Impedance and electrical constraints

Inspection history

The system generates:

Dynamic risk scores

Early warning alerts

Preventive maintenance recommendations

Inspection logging and scheduling

It shifts transformer management from reactive repair to predictive prevention.

 Key Features

Real-time transformer health dashboard

Hubli–Dharwad region-based transformer map

AI-based multi-parameter risk scoring

Transformer oil aging analysis graph

Electrical core specifications display

Role-based access (Engineer & Citizen view)

Maintenance scheduling module

Inspection logging system

 How It Is Different

Traditional systems monitor isolated parameters and trigger alerts only after thresholds are crossed.

AI Smart Grid Monitor:

Analyzes multiple variables simultaneously

Identifies abnormal parameter combinations

Predicts risk probability

Supports public transparency through citizen dashboard

It integrates engineering intelligence with smart city infrastructure visibility.
