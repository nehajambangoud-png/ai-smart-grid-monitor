# ⚡ ASH-Grid AI  
## Autonomous Self-Healing Transformer Network for Smart Grid Resilience 🤖🌍

ASH-Grid AI is a next-generation **AI-powered Smart Grid Intelligence Platform** designed to move beyond monitoring and prediction — towards **autonomous prevention, adaptation, and self-optimization** of transformer networks in real time.

Unlike traditional systems that only raise alerts after damage begins, ASH-Grid continuously evaluates transformer stress, simulates corrective strategies, and recommends optimal self-healing interventions *before failure occurs*.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Modern power grids face increasing stress due to:

- Transformer aging and thermal overload  
- Rapid urban demand growth  
- Climate-driven peak loads (heatwaves, seasonal surges)  
- Unpredictable fault propagation  
- Critical infrastructure dependency (hospitals, water systems)

Current monitoring systems are reactive.  
ASH-Grid AI introduces a proactive, self-healing approach for future-ready urban grids.
