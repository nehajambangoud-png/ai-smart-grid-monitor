# ⚡ ASH-Grid AI  
## Autonomous Self-Healing Transformer Network for Smart Grid Resilience 🤖

ASH-Grid AI is a next-generation **AI-powered Smart Grid Intelligence Platform** designed to move beyond monitoring and prediction — towards **autonomous prevention, adaptation, and self-optimization** of transformer networks in real time.

Unlike traditional systems that only raise alerts after damage begins, ASH-Grid continuously evaluates transformer stress, simulates corrective strategies, and recommends optimal self-healing interventions *before failure occurs*.

---

##  Problem Statement

Modern power grids face increasing stress due to:

- Transformer aging and thermal overload  
- Rapid urban demand growth  
- Climate-driven peak loads (heatwaves, seasonal surges)  
- Unpredictable fault propagation  
- Critical infrastructure dependency (hospitals, water systems)

Current monitoring systems are reactive.  
ASH-Grid AI introduces a proactive, self-healing approach for future-ready urban grids.

##  Solution Overview

ASH-Grid AI acts as an **AI Copilot for Grid Operators**, combining:

✅ Real-time transformer health intelligence  
✅ Load forecasting and anomaly detection  
✅ Self-healing simulation and optimization actions  
✅ Infrastructure-aware resilience prioritization  
✅ Grid-wide stability scoring for smart cities

##  Key Features

###  Transformer Stress DNA Profiling  
Each transformer is modeled with a unique **Stress DNA Profile**, calculated from:

- Thermal stress accumulation  
- Electrical fatigue index  
- Load imbalance score  
- Environmental stress factor  
- Mechanical vibration fatigue  

---

###  Autonomous Self-Healing Recommendation Engine  
ASH-Grid does not just alert — it simulates corrective outcomes:

- Load reduction strategies  
- Power factor correction  
- Cooling improvement actions  
- Redistribution to nearby transformers  

Example Output:

> “Optimal corrective action with 92% confidence to extend transformer life by 2.3 years.”

###  Community-Aware Grid Protection  
The system prioritizes power reliability for critical zones:

- Hospitals  
- Schools  
- Water supply networks  

This enables humanitarian, infrastructure-first AI decision making.

---

###  Climate & Seasonal Overload Forecasting  
ASH-Grid predicts overload risks during:

- Heatwaves  
- Festival demand spikes  
- Seasonal consumption surges  

---

### Transformer Life Extension + Cost Savings  
The platform estimates:
